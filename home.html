        <p>NYC Open Data is an open data platform provided by the New York City government. This platform provides a large number of data sets on various public affairs in New York City, covering areas such as public health, education, transportation, safety, and the environment. Through these open data, anyone can easily obtain information and conduct analysis.<br>




The core dataset used on this website is "Leading Causes of Death", which contains data from 2007-2014 on leading causes of death by sex and race. Include year, leading cause, sex, race ethnicity, deaths, death rate and Age Adjusted Death Rate.<br>




The cause-of-death dataset has important public health implications, not only helping us understand which health issues pose the greatest threat to New York City residents, but also providing a basis for public policy formulation and resource allocation.<br>




In addition to the basic display of the data set, our website also provides information cards, which make each piece of data into a card so that users can view it more conveniently. In addition, we also include analysis pages to display our database in different ways.<br>
